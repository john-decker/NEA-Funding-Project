# NEA Funding Project
 Code and Data for NEA Fundig Analysis
 
 Project Abstract
 This study explores funding for the National Endowment for the Arts across a 50 year period (1970-2020). Statistical analysis of the data shows that state-level NEA funding is strongly related to economic factors but national-level appropriations are affected by the political party holding a majority in the House of Representatives. Specifically, this study demonstrates that funding for the NEA flourishes under Democrat majorities and languishes under Republican rule. The beginning assumption for this paper is that the arts, as a form of free speech and expression, are an important element of participatory democracy. Defunding the arts has a chilling effect on free and open discourse and may be seen as having fundamentally anti-democtatic effects on American society.
